## About The Project

![screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10023615/93024898-4e815180-f617-11ea-8fef-e1ca4c9ec442.png)

Dalal is a powerful, in-flight webhook transformation service to connect absolutely any 2 services with very few lines of code - writen in your favourite language!

To know more about the core service, head to the [Dalal](https://github.com/ghostwriternr/dalal) repo.

### Built With

-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) with [TS](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) & [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
-   [Ant Design](https://ant.design/docs/react/introduce) and [Nivo](https://nivo.rocks/)

## Usage Instructions

1. Create a new channel from the home page.
2. Write a transformation function in any language desired, which will take in the data passed when the webhook is called, and use that to forward the data to desired service in the required format.
3. Add the url of the desired service, where you want to forward the request, in the target URL.
4. Click on Save.

## Getting Started
